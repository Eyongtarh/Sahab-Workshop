### Bugs

#### Unfixed Bugs

I have not noticed any unfixed bug at the moment.

#### Fixed Bugs

- The Menu bar was at the edge of the right.
  * Solution: I added two spacing tags to move it from the edge.

- The form section width was extensive in laptops and desktop screen sizes. 
  * Solution: This was resolved by setting reducing the width percentage for larger screen sizes.

- The header overlaped the nav section.
  * Solution: The remedy was to add margin-top to nav section to push it down to the base of header.
